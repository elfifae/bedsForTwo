We are looking to expand our options for new double beds! Please do not
hesitate to submit or request beds you'd like to have! There are only a few
things to keep in mind when contributing:

* The bed MUST be wider than its base counterpart to better space out its
  occupants. The same does not necessarily apply for tents or other loungeable
  objects, so long as there is space for both people. Also, it's recommended to
  include a second pillow where applicable. Have you tried to sleep beside
  someone with only one pillow between the two of you? Even when cuddling, it's
  not that pleasant unless you use your partner as the pillow, and that's not
  really an option in Starbound.
* Please make sure to optimize your .PNG files in order to strip out all
  unnecessary elements.
