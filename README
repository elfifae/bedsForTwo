Beds For Two, by Temia Eszteri

Do you feel like you're not close enough with your partner, for all the
experiences you've shared through the cosmos? Swap out your old single bed for
a double bed, and you two can enjoy each other's company as you rest after a
long day of mining and monster slaying.

This mod is inspired by Audie's Shareable Beds and introduces double beds, wider versions of standard beds that can be occupied by two people. They have some notable limitations (the margin of error to get into one side is rather narrow), and the mod is very much a work in progress, there being only four beds at present: two Wooden Double Beds, the Basic Double Bed, and the Traditional Double Bed. However, with your support and contributions, the range of options will expand that much faster!

To Install:
	* Run build.sh to create a packed or unpacked version of the mod at your
	preference.
	* Place the unpacked directory or .pak file into Starbound/mods
    * Alternatively, subscribe to the Steam Workshop release at
      <workshop-goes-here>

To Use:
	The basic wooden double beds are unlocked by opening the wooden workbench
    for the first time. Thereafter, more double beds can be exchanged in the
	wooden or industrial workbench after finding their single variants.

I hope you enjoy this mod! If you have any problems or suggestions, please open
