Beds For Two
Written by Temia Eszteri, based on Shareable Beds by Audie

Do you feel like you're not close enough with your partner, for all the
experiences you've shared through the cosmos? Swap out your old single bed for
a double bed, and you two can enjoy each other's company as you rest after a
long day of mining and monster slaying.

This mod introduces double beds, wider versions of standard beds that can be
occupied by two people. They have some notable limitations (crew members will
not enter an occupied bed, even if there is a space available), and the mod is
very much a work in progress, there being only a few double beds available for
use, but with your support and contributions, the range of options will expand
that much faster!

To Install:
	* Run build.sh to create a packed or unpacked version of the mod at your
	preference.
	* Place the unpacked directory or .pak file into Starbound/mods
    * Alternatively, subscribe to the Steam Workshop release at
      <workshop-goes-here>

To Use:
	The basic wooden double beds are unlocked by opening the wooden workbench
    for the first time. Thereafter, more double beds can be exchanged in the
	wooden or industrial workbench after finding their single variants.

I hope you enjoy this mod! If you have any problems or suggestions, please open
